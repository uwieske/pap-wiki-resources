## Getting Started
After having cloned this git repo, you need to setup your local machine for development to get started.

Please refer to GETTING_STARTED.md to read how to get started.

**Mind you:**
You are not obliged to create an environment in order to work. You can develop without a conda environment or within another environment other than `papenv`, but it is safer to work in an isolated space in order to prevent dependency issues with other project on your local machine.
